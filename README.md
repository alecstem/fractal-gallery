# Fractal Gallery
Some fractal screenshots from my ASCII fractal viewer. It runs in the console, and the blocky appearance from the ASCII characters give the pictures a unique appearance (in my opinion). The code for it is quite messy at the moment, however I will probably get around to cleaning it up and adding it to this repository in the future.

## Examples
  <img src="gallery/9.png" width="450" height="450" ><img src="gallery/11.png" width="450" height="450" >
  <img src="gallery/24.png" width="450" height="450" > <img src="gallery/8.png" width="450" height="450" >
  <img src="gallery/10.png" width="450" height="450" > <img src="gallery/21.png" width="450" height="450" >
